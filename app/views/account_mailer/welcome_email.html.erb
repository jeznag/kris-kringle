    <h1>Your Kris Kringle account is ready for your family: <%= @account.account_name %></h1>
    <p>
      You can now start adding family members to your family tree and generate Kris Kringle matches.
    </p>
    <p>
      To make changes to your Kris Kringle, use this URL: <%= @admin_url %>.
    </p>
    <p>      
      <b>Make sure you don't lose this URL as you won't be able to get into your account otherwise. I suggest you save it in a password manager or keep this email :)</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      However, you probably don't want to send that link out to everyone as they'll be able to make changes. Send this email to family members when you're happy with the setup: <%= @url %>.
    </p>
    <p>Thanks for joining and have a great day!</p>
